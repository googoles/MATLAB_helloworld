%% Prime Factors
% This code gets user input number, calculates and displays its prime factors.
% For this, first it determines prime numbers which are less than or equal to
% user input number. Then if the input is dividable by that prime number,
% it becomes one of input's prime factors.

%% Request user input
prompt = 'Input your number: ';
n = input(prompt);

%%
counter = 0; % initialize number of prime factors
